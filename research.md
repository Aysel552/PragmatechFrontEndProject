### Question1: In which areas do we use JavaScript?
```
First of all, it is important to note what JavaScript is. --JavaScript-- is a --text-based-- programming language used both on the --client-side-- and --server-side-- that allows us to make web pages more interactive. The difference between HTML/CSS and JavaScript is that HTML/CSS gives the structure and style to web pages,while javaScript gives web pages interactive elements that engage(attracting) a user. Common examples of JavaScript usage on a daily life can include the search box on Amazon,refreshing social media feed.JavaScript improves the user experience of the web page by converting  it from a static page to interactive(dynamic) one.In other words, JavaScript adds a behaviour to web pages. Below are just a few examples where we can use Javascript:

-Show or hide information with the clik of a button
-Change the color of a button when the mouse hovers on it
-Slide through a carousel of images on homepage
-Displaying a timer or count-down on a website
-Playing audio and video in a web page
-Displaying animations
-Using a dropdown hamburger menu
-Zooming in or zooming out on an image
```
### In which areas JavaScript could be used?
```
Honestly speaking, there are no limits of JavaScript using.Here are the areas of using JavaScript:
*Creating web and mobile apps;
*Building web servers and developing server applications(JavaScript can be used to built simple web servers and develop the back-end infrastructure using Node.js.)
*Game development (use JavaScript to create browser games.)

## Question2: Give a short description to terms below:
### What are compilers?
```
** compilers ** - A compiler is a computer program that translates computer code written in one programming language(the source language) into another language(the target language).The generated code can be later executed many times against different data each time. In other words a compiler is a software thatconvers the high level language to machine/binary language. The name "compiler" is primarily used for programs that source code from a high-level programming language to a lower level language.
```
### What are interpreters?

* Execution time is more.
**interpreters** - An interpreter transforms or interprets a high-level programming code into code that can be understood by the machine (machine code) or into an intermediate language that can be easily executed as well.The interpreter reads each statement of code line by line and then converts or executes it directly.In contrast, a compiler coverts a high-level source code into native(compiled) code that can be executed directly by the operating system. Interpreter can work in 3 ways: directly execute the source code and produce an output;  translate the source code in ome intermediate code and then execute the code; use an internal compiler to produce precompiled code and then execute the precompiled code.

### What are the differences between compilers and interpreters?
The difference between compiler and interpreter?
The major difference is that the compiler compiles the whole program at once,while the interpreter executes it line by line. Rather than scanning the whole program and translating it into machine code like a compiler does, the interpreter translates code one statement at a time.

There are 4 types of interpreters:
*Bytecode interpreters
*Threaded code interpreters
*Abstract Syntax Tree interpreters
*Self interpreters

### What are benefits and drawbacks of interpreters?
Advantages of Interpreters:
*Executes line by line. Hence, debugging is easy;
*No intermediate code hence uses the memory efficiently.

Disadvantages of Interpreters:
* Execution time is more.

Examples:
Programming languages that use interpreters include Python, Ruby, and JavaScript, while programming languages that use compilers include Java, C++, and C.

### What are translators?
Translator is a program that converts source code into object code.The main purpose of the translator is to make the machine understand the program written in a low/assembly/high-level language. Any program written in a high level language is known as source code. However, computers cannot understand source code. Before it can be run, source code must first be translated into a form which a computer understands - this form is called object code.
### The types of translator?
Generally, there are three types of translator:
* compilers
* interpreters
* assemblers

### What are assemblers?
An assembler is the conversion of instructions in low-level code to machine code by assembler.Whereas compilers and interpreters generate many machine code instructions for each high level instruction, assemblers create one machine code instruction for each assembly instruction.

### The Features of Assemblers?
* It requires less amount of memory and execution time
* it does complex hardware-specific jobs in an easy way
* it is ideal for a time-critical job
