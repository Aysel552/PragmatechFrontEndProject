### Question1: In which areas do we use JavaScript?
```
First of all, it is important to note what JavaScript is. --JavaScript-- is a --text-based-- programming language used both on the --client-side-- and --server-side-- that allows us to make web pages more interactive. The difference between HTML/CSS and JavaScript is that HTML/CSS gives the structure and style to web pages,while javaScript gives web pages interactive elements that engage(attracting) a user. Common examples of JavaScript usage on a daily life can include the search box on Amazon,refreshing social media feed.JavaScript improves the user experience of the web page by converting  it from a static page to interactive(dynamic) one.In other words, JavaScript adds a behaviour to web pages. Below are just a few examples where we can use Javascript:

-Show or hide information with the clik of a button
-Change the color of a button when the mouse hovers on it
-Slide through a carousel of images on homepage
-Displaying a timer or count-down on a website
-Playing audio and video in a web page
-Displaying animations
-Using a dropdown hamburger menu
-Zooming in or zooming out on an image
```
### In which areas JavaScript could be used?
```
Honestly speaking, there are no limits of JavaScript using.Here are the areas of using JavaScript:
*Creating web and mobile apps;
*Building web servers and developing server applications(JavaScript can be used to built simple web servers and develop the back-end infrastructure using Node.js.)
*Game development (use JavaScript to create browser games.)

## Question2: Give a short description to terms below:
### What are compilers?
```
** compilers ** - A compiler is a computer program that translates computer code written in one programming language(the source language) into another language(the target language).The generated code can be later executed many times against different data each time. In other words a compiler is a software thatconvers the high level language to machine/binary language. The name "compiler" is primarily used for programs that source code from a high-level programming language to a lower level language.
```
### What are interpreters?

* Execution time is more.
** interpreters ** - An interpreter transforms or interprets a high-level programming code into code that can be understood by the machine (machine code) or into an intermediate language that can be easily executed as well.The interpreter reads each statement of code line by line and then converts or executes it directly.In contrast, a compiler coverts a high-level source code into native(compiled) code that can be executed directly by the operating system. Interpreter can work in 3 ways: directly execute the source code and produce an output;  translate the source code in ome intermediate code and then execute the code; use an internal compiler to produce precompiled code and then execute the precompiled code.

### What are the differences between compilers and interpreters?
The difference between compiler and interpreter?
The major difference is that the compiler compiles the whole program at once,while the interpreter executes it line by line. Rather than scanning the whole program and translating it into machine code like a compiler does, the interpreter translates code one statement at a time.

There are 4 types of interpreters:
*Bytecode interpreters
*Threaded code interpreters
*Abstract Syntax Tree interpreters
*Self interpreters

### What are benefits and drawbacks of interpreters?
Advantages of Interpreters:
*Executes line by line. Hence, debugging is easy;
*No intermediate code hence uses the memory efficiently.

Disadvantages of Interpreters:
* Execution time is more.

Examples:
Programming languages that use interpreters include Python, Ruby, and JavaScript, while programming languages that use compilers include Java, C++, and C.

### What are translators?
Translator is a program that converts source code into object code.The main purpose of the translator is to make the machine understand the program written in a low/assembly/high-level language. Any program written in a high level language is known as source code. However, computers cannot understand source code. Before it can be run, source code must first be translated into a form which a computer understands - this form is called object code.
### The types of translator?
Generally, there are three types of translator:
* compilers
* interpreters
* assemblers

### What are assemblers?
An assembler is the conversion of instructions in low-level code to machine code by assembler.Whereas compilers and interpreters generate many machine code instructions for each high level instruction, assemblers create one machine code instruction for each assembly instruction.

### The Features of Assemblers?
* It requires less amount of memory and execution time
* it does complex hardware-specific jobs in an easy way
* it is ideal for a time-critical job

### What are programming paradigms?
Programming paradigms are a way to classify programming languages based on their features.

### Common programming paradigms?
* imperative - in which the programmer instructs the machine how to change its state,
* procedural - which groups instructions into procedures,
* object-oriented - which groups instructions with the part of the state they operate on,
* declarative - in which the programmer merely declares properties of the desired result, but not how to compute it
* functional - in which the desired result is declared as the value of a series of function applications,
* logic - in which the desired result is declared as the answer to a question about a system of facts and rules,
* mathematical - in which the desired result is declared as the solution of an optimization problem
* reactive - in which the desired result is declared with data streams and the propagation of change

### What is debugging?
* Debugging is a process of analyzing how the program runs, how it generates data in order to find defects and issues in the code. The errors or defects are referred to "bugs".

### What is boolean?
* Boolean is a data type that has one of two possible values which is true or false.

### What is char?
* A char is a data type stores character data in a fixed-length field.The char type is used to store single characters(letters, digits, symbols)
### What is null?
* In coputer programming,null is both a value and a pointer.Null is a built-in constant that has a value of zero.Null means that there is no value,we are lookng at a blank/empty cell.
### What is command-line interface?
* A command-line interface(CLI) connects a user to a computer program or operating system.Through the CLI, users interact with a system or application by typing in text (commands). The command is typed on a specific line following a visual prompt from the computer. A command-line interface (CLI) is a text-based user interface (UI) used to run programs, manage computer files and interact with the computer. Command-line interfaces are also called command-line user interfaces, console user interfaces and character user interfaces.

### What is low-level language?
* Low-level language is machine-oriented.Low-level programs are expressed in terms of the machine operations.A low-level language is a type of programming language that contains basic instructions recognized by a computer.Low-level code is often cryptic and not human-readable.
### Examples of Low-level language?
* Two types of low-level language are: machine code and assembly language

### What is high-level language?
*A high-level language is any programming language that enables development of a program in a much more user-friendly programming context and is generally independent of the computer's hardware architecture. A high-level language has a higher level of abstraction from the computer, and focuses more on the programming logic rather than the underlying hardware components. The main difference between high level language and low level language is that, Programmers can easily understand or interpret or compile the high level language in comparison of machine. On the other hand, Machine can easily understand the low level language in comparison of human beings.
### Examples of high-level language?
* BASIC, C/C++ and Java are popular examples of high-level languages.

### What is markup language?
* A markup language is a computer language that uses tags to define elements within a document. It is human-readable, meaning markup files contain standard words, rather than typical programming syntax. While several markup languages exist, the two most popular are HTML and XML.

#### Question3: What are the difference between internet ve intranet?
* The Internet is a globally-connected network of computers that enables people to share information and communicate with each other. Internet is used to connect the different networks of computers simultaneously. It is a public network therefore anyone can access the internet. On the internet, there are multiple users and it provides an unlimited of information to the users. 
* An intranet is a local or restricted network that enables people to store, organize, and share information within an organization. Intranet is the type of internet that is used privately. It is a private network therefore anyone can’t access the intranet. On the intranet, there is a limited number of users and it provides a piece of limited information to its users. 

* The main difference is that an intranet is a platform that can be bought and sold (or built, in some cases), while the Internet is the underlying technology that enables its connectivity. Internet is unsafe. Intranet is safe.

### What means server-side and client-side?
* Server-side: server-side website programming mostly involves choosing which content is returned to the browser in response to requests. The server-side code handles tasks like validating submitted data and requests, using databases to store and retrieve data and sending the correct data to the client as required. Server-side code can be written in any number of programming languages — examples of popular server-side web languages include PHP, Python, Ruby, C#, and JavaScript (NodeJS). The server-side code has full access to the server operating system and the developer can choose what programming language (and specific version) they wish to use.
* Client-side: client-side code and is primarily concerned with improving the appearance and behavior of a rendered web page. This includes selecting and styling UI components, creating layouts, navigation, form validation, etc. By contrast, server-side website programming mostly involves choosing which content is returned to the browser in response to requests. The server-side code handles tasks like validating submitted data and requests, using databases to store and retrieve data and sending the correct data to the client as required.
Client-side code is written using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — it is run inside a web browser and has little or no access to the underlying operating system (including limited access to the file system).
### What is server and how it works?
A server stores, sends and receives data.
### How the server works?
* a server is a repository for web pages that respond when someone requests a certain website. This ‘request’ is simply the act of entering the web address into a browser and hitting return. The server monitors these requests via ports, giving their ‘response‘ nearly instantly to deliver the site page requested. Once the server has received and verified the request at-hand, it gathers the assorted elements that make up a website and communicates this assembled information back to the user’s web browser.  At its core, request-response is the key to what work a server does, day in and day out.
### What is domain and how it works?
* A domain is the name of a website. Domain name is the address of your website that people type in the browser URL bar to visit your website. It's what comes after “@” in an email address, or after “www.” in a web address. A domain name is a human-friendly address, sometimes called a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) or web address.
### How works the domain?
* When enter a domain name in the web browser, it first sends a request to a global network of servers that form the Domain Name System (DNS).
* These servers then look up for the name servers associated with the domain and forward the request to those name servers.
* These name servers are computers managed by a hosting company.Hosting company will forward the request to the computer where the website is stored.
* This computer is called a web server. It has special software installed (Apache, Nginx are two popular web server software). The web server now fetches the web page and pieces of information associated with it.
* Finally, it then sends this data back to the browser.

### What is HTTP for?
* HTTP is a protocol for fetching resources such as HTML documents.It is the foundation of any data exchange on the Web and it is a client-server protocol, which means requests are initiated by the recipient, usually the Web browser.
### What are the differences between URL and URI?
* URL is used to describe the identity of an item. URL links a web page, a component of a web page or a program on a web page with the help of accessing methods like protocols. URL provides the details about what type of protocol is to be used.URL is a type of URI.
* URI provides a technique for defining the identity of an item. URI is used to distinguish one resource from other regardless of the method used. URI doesn’t contains the protocol specification.URI is the superset of URL.

## Imperative and Declarative Approach in programming. 
#### [Imperative & Declarative](https://github.com/PragmatechEducation/FrontEnd03)

#### Question1: What is a programming paradigm?
**Programming paradigm** is a way to classify programming languages based on their features. There is **another definition** of programming paradigm. **A programming paradigm is a method to solve a problem using tools and techniques that are available to us following some approach.** There are a lot of well-known programming languages,however, all of them need to follow some strategy when they are implemented and this strategy/approach is a paradigm.

#### Question2: What is Imperative Programming?
Imperative programming is **a type of programming paradigm/approach** that describes  **how the program executes.** ( тип парадигмы программирования, который описывает, как программа выполняется.)
* Developers are more concerned with how to get an answer step by step.
* Imperative Programming comprises the sequence of command imperatives, where **the order of execution is very important.**
* Imperative Programming uses mutable and immutable data.
* Fortran, Java, C, C++ are examples of imperative programming.

#### Question3: What is Declarative Programming?
Declarative Programming is **a type of programming paradigm** that describes **what programs to be executed.** (тип парадигмы программирования, который описывает, какие программы должны выполняться.)
* Developers are more concerned with the answer that is received.
* Declarative Programming is **mainly focuses on end result.**
* Declarative programming **expresses the logic of computation.**

#### Question4: What are the differences between Imperative and Declarative?
Imperative Programming:
- programs specify **how it is to be done**
- describes **the control flow** of computation(the order)
- main goal is to describe **how to get it or accomplish it.**
- the benefit is **it is easy to learn & read**, also **the notional model is simple to understand**
includes: 
* procedural programming
* object-oriented programming
* parallel processing approach.
- **the user is allowed to make decisions and commands to the compiler**
- has many **side effects** and includes **mutable variables**
- **gives full control** to developers that is very important in low-level programming


Declarative Programming:
- programs specify **what is to be done.**
- simply **expresses the logic of computation**
- main goal is **to describe the desired result without direct dictation on how to get it.**
- the benefit  **include effective code,** which can be applied by using ways, **easy extension**, **high level of abstraction**
includes:
* logic programming
* functional programming
- **A compiler is allowed to make decisions**
- **no side effects and does not include any mutable variables**
- may **automate repetitive flow** with **simplifying code structure**.

### Find examples from real life about imperative & declarative

Imperative - sequence of actions - for example you cook paella - boiling rice, seafood.Declarative paella is cooked as visible result.

### What do you think about designing programming languages?
The style of writing code.The hierarchy of operations.

### What is the difference between declarative and function?
For us it is not important  which operations are processing in functions.
For us it is vital that the function works itself and gives us appropriate result.

<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
## Function in Javascript 
#### [JavaScript Function & Function Expressions](https://www.programiz.com/javascript/function)
#### [JavaScript Functions](https://javascript.info/function-basics)

### What is function?
Function is a block of code that performs a specific task. Functions allow the code to be called many times without repetition.

### How to declare a function?
The syntax to declare a function:
* A function is declared using the function keyword;
* The basic rules of naming a function are similar to naming a variable.It is better to give a descriptive name for the function. For example, if you multiply 2 numbers,it is better to name the function multiply or multiplyNumbers
* The body of function must be written within {}

```
function nameOfFunction (){
    //function body
}
```
```
//declaring a function named greet()

function greet(){
    console.log("Hi");
}
```
### How to call a function?
To use the function,we need to call it. The function can be called as many times as we need.
```
//function call:
greet();
```

### Function Parameters:
A function can also be declared with parameters.
### What is a parameter?
A parameter is **a value that is passed when declaring a function**

```
//declaring a function.Inside of paranthesis is a parameter.

function greet(name){
    console.log('HI')
}
```

Note: when a **value is passed when declaring a function** it is called **parameter**
When **the function is called**, **the value passed is called argument**

### What means function return?
The return statement means that the function has ended.Any code after return is not executed.
If nothing is returned,then the function returns an undefined value.

### What are the benefits of using functions?
* Functions makes the code reusable,which means declare the code once, and use it multiple times;
* functions makes the program easier as each small task is divided into a function;
* function increases readability

### What is a local variable?
 **A local variable** is a variable **declared inside a function**. Local variable is ONLY visible INSIDE THAT FUNCTION.

 ```
 function showMessage(){
    let message = "Hello, I'm JS"; //local variable
    alert(message);
 }

 showMessage(); // Hello, I'm JS

 alert(message); // Error! The variable is local to the function.
 ```

### What is an outer variable?

A function can access an outer variable:

```
let username = 'John' // an outer variable

function showMessage(){
    let message = 'Hello, ' + userName;
    alert(message)
}

showMessage();
```

The function has full access to the outer variable and can modify it. **The outer variable is only used if there is NO LOCAL VARIABLE**

```
let userName = 'John'; // outer variable

function showMessage(){
    userName = 'Bob'; // local variable

    let message = 'Hello, ' + userName;
    alert(message);
}

alert(userName); // John 

showMessage();

alert(userName); // Bob
```

### What is a global variable?
Variables declared outside of any function are called global.
Global variables are visible from any function(unless shadowed by locals)(если они не затенены локальными переменными)
* minimize the use of global variables;
* modern code has few or no globals;
* sometimes global variables can be useful to store project-level data

### What is a scope? 
#### [JS Scope](https://linuxhint.com/javascript-global-function-block-scope-explained/)

Scope determines the accesibility(visibility) of variables, objects, functions from different parts of the code.

### How many types of scope are there in JS?
Javascript has 3 types of scope:
* Block scope
* Function scope
* Global scope

### What is a block scope?
Block scope is also a sub-type of local scope. Before ES6(2015), JavaScript had only Global and Function Scope. ES6 introduced two vital new JS keywords: **let and const**
**let and const provide Block Scope in JS**
Block Scope - variables declared inside a {} block CANNOT BE ACCESSED FROM OUTSIDE THE BLOCK.

```
Example:
{
    let x = 2;
}
// x CANNOT be used outside of {} block
```

### What about var?
Variables declared with the var keyword can NOT have block scope.
Variables declared inside a {} block can be accessed from outside the block.

```
{
    var x = 2;
}
// x CAN be used outside the block
```

### What means Local Scope?
Variables declared within a JS function, become LOCAL to the function. Local variables has a Function Scope.It means that they can be accessed from within the function(Доступ к ним возможен только из самой функции.). Since local variables are only recognized INSIDE their functions,variables with the same name can be used in different functions. Local variables are created when a function starts, and deleted when the function is completed.

```
// code cannot use carName

function myFunction(){
    let carName = "Volvo"; //local scope
    // code can use carName here
}
// code cannot use carName
```

### What is Function Scope?
Each function creates a new scope.Variables defined inside a function are not visible from outside the function. Variables declared with var, let and const are quite similar when declared inside a function. They all have Function Scope:

```
function myFunction() {
  var carName = "Volvo";   // Function Scope
}

function myFunction() {
  let carName = "Volvo";   // Function Scope
}

function myFunction() {
  const carName = "Volvo";   // Function Scope
}

```

### What is Global Scope?
A varible declared OUTSIDE A FUNCTION becomes GLOBAL. A global variable has Global Scope.Global variables can be accessed from anywhere in JS program

```
let carName = "Volvo"; // global variable,as it is declared outside a function
// code can use carName

function myFunction(){
    // can use carName
}
```
Variables declared with var, let and const are quite similar when declared outside a block.
They all have Global Scope

```
var x = 2;       // Global scope

let x = 2;       // Global scope

const x = 2;       // Global scope
```

### What are the differences between Function scope and Global scope?

* The Function Scope is the accessibility(visibility) of the variables defined **inside a function,** these variables cannot be accessed from any other function or even outside the function in the main file.

```
Example:
function abc() {

year = 2021;

// the "year" variable can be accessed inside this function

console.log("The year is "+ Year);
}

// the "year" variable cannot be accessed outside here

abc();
```

* Global Scope - A varible declared OUTSIDE A FUNCTION. Global variables can be accessed from anywhere in JS program

### How does function take place in the ram?
Function variables takes place in stack.Show the result when calling the function and then removing from the memory.

### What is a principe of JS?
JavaScript allocates memory when things (objects, strings, etc.) are created and “automatically” frees it up when they are not used anymore, a process called garbage collection. This seemingly “automatical” nature of freeing up resources is a source of confusion and gives JavaScript (and other high-level-language) developers the false impression they can choose not to care about memory management.

### How many steps are in memory-life cycle?
* Allocate memory
* Use memory
* Release memory

### What is allocate memory?
**Allocate memory** - memory is allocated (выделена) by the operating system which allows the program to use it. For intance in low-level languages (C) this operation should be handle by developer.In contrast, in high-level languages,this operation is taken care of for you.

### What is use memory?
**Use memory** - this is the time when the program actually makes use of the previously allocated memory.(это время, когда ваша программа фактически использует ранее выделенную память). Read and write operations are taking place as you’re using the allocated(выделенные) variables in your code.

### What is release memory?
**Release memory** - now is the time to release the entire memory that you don't need so that it can become free and available again.

### What is static allocation?
**Static Allocation** - is done before program execution:
* once the memory is allocated,the memory size cannot change
* Size must be known at compile time 
* Performed at compile time
* Assigned to the stack
* FILO(first-in,last-out)

### What is dynamic allocation?
**Dynamic Allocation** - is done during program execution:

* * once the memory is allocated,the memory size can change
* Size must be unknown at compile time
* Performed at run time
* Assigned to the heap
* No particular order of assignment

### What is garbage collection?
JavaScript allocates memory when things (objects, strings, etc.) are created and “automatically” frees it up when they are not used anymore, this process is called **garbage collection.**

### What is hoisting?
**Hoisting** is a process whereby the interpreter appears to move the declaration of functions,variables or classes to the top of their scope, prior(before) execution of the code.

In other words:
**Hoisting** is a mechanism where function/variables declarations in the program are moved to the top of their scope before code execution.

* In addition,hoisting allows functions to be safely used in code before they are declared;
* variable and class declarations are also hoisted, so they can be referenced(ссылаться) before they are declared.However it can lead unexpected errors and NOT generally recommended.

One of the advantages of hoisting is that it lets you use a function before you declare it in your code.

```
Example:

catName("Tiger"); // hoisting

function catName(name) {
  console.log("My cat's name is " + name);
}
/*
The result of the code above is: "My cat's name is Tiger"
*/
```
**var hoisting**
Here we declare then initialize the value of a var after using it. The default initialization of the var is undefined.

```
console.log(num); // Returns 'undefined' from hoisted var declaration (not 6)
var num; // Declaration
num = 6; // Initialization
console.log(num); // Returns 6 after the line with initialization is executed.
```

**let and const hoisting**
Variables declared with let and const are also hoisted but, unlike var, are not initialized with a default value

```
console.log(num); // Throws ReferenceError exception as the variable value is uninitialized
let num = 6; // Initialization
```

### What is the difference between scope and hoisting?

Hoisting - is a mechanism where function/variables declarations in the program are **moved to the top of their scope** before code execution.

Scope determines the accessibility(visibility) of variables in JS.There are 3 types of scope: functional, global and block.
