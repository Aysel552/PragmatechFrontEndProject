### Question1: In which areas do we use JavaScript?
```
First of all, it is important to note what JavaScript is. --JavaScript-- is a --text-based-- programming language used both on the --client-side-- and --server-side-- that allows us to make web pages more interactive. The difference between HTML/CSS and JavaScript is that HTML/CSS gives the structure and style to web pages,while javaScript gives web pages interactive elements that engage(attracting) a user. Common examples of JavaScript usage on a daily life can include the search box on Amazon,refreshing social media feed.JavaScript improves the user experience of the web page by converting  it from a static page to interactive(dynamic) one.In other words, JavaScript adds a behaviour to web pages. Below are just a few examples where we can use Javascript:

-Show or hide information with the clik of a button
-Change the color of a button when the mouse hovers on it
-Slide through a carousel of images on homepage
-Displaying a timer or count-down on a website
-Playing audio and video in a web page
-Displaying animations
-Using a dropdown hamburger menu
-Zooming in or zooming out on an image
